Actors
======

Schedy supports controlling different types of actors such as thermostats
or switches. You have to decide for one actor type per instance of
Schedy you run. If you need to controll different types of actors,
create an instance of Schedy for each.

Currently, the following actor types are available:

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 1

   */index
