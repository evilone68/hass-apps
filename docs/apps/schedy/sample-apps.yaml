  # By default, Schedy applies schedules at startup so that all rooms

  # values won't be changed initially until the next scheduled value
  # change occurs.

  # Here you can define Python modules that should be available

  # In the following config block, you may define templates with
  # settings that affect multiple actors in your setup. These can then be
  # used as a starting point for the configuration of individual actors.
  actor_templates:

    # Each template needs to have a name.
    # The "default" template is always present, no matter if you define
    # it or not. Of course it will be empty by default.

      # These settings are valid for all actor types. Actor
      # type-specific settings can be found in the documentation.

      # An alternative friendly name to display in logs.

      # This setting tells Schedy how often it should try sending a
      # value to the actor. If the actor reports the set value back, no
      # further retry is made. You may find this useful if the connection
      # between Home Assistant and your actor is unreliable. Set to 0 in
      # order to disable retrying. -1 removes the limit and causes the
      # value to be re-sent until the actor reports it back in its state
      # (avoid this whenever possible).

      # How many seconds to wait before retrying.

      # Set this value to a number of minutes and Schedy will automatically
      # re-schedule the value after a manual change has been made.
      # If you, for instance, change the target temperature at one of your
      # thermostats and this value is set to 120, Heaty will again apply
