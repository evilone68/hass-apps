Configuration
=============

There is no graphical user interface for configuring Schedy. You'll have
to express your configuration and schedules in a YAML file. However,
if you've ever written an automation or script in Home Assistant, this
is nothing you should be worried about.

This is a sample configuration with comments on each available
setting. Copy it to a ``.yaml`` file in your ``apps`` directory and
adapt it to your needs.

.. literalinclude:: sample-apps.yaml
   :language: yaml
